# Hey all !

This repository consists the preliminary analysis and proposed solutions of the datasets I come across on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=ts&sort=attUp&view=table).

Feel free to open an issue if you find something off or to suggest improvements!
